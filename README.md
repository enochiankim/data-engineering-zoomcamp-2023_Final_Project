# FAANG Stock Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This goal project of this project was to apply everything I learned and build an end-to-end datapipline from the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2023](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp). 

In order to achieve the overall goal: 
1. Select a dataset.
2. Create a pipeline to process the dataset into a datalake. 
3. Create a pipeline to move the dataset from the datalake into a data warehouse.
4. Transform the data in the data warehouse and prepare it for dashboard use.
5. Create a dashboard.
