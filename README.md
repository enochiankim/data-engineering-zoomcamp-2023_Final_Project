# FAANG Stock Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This goal project of this project was to apply everything I learned and build an end-to-end datapipline from the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2023](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp). 

In order to achieve the overall goal: 
1. Select a dataset.
2. Create a pipeline to process the dataset into a datalake. 
3. Create a pipeline to move the dataset from the datalake into a data warehouse.
4. Transform the data in the data warehouse and prepare it for dashboard use.
5. Create a dashboard. 

## What are FAANG Stocks?

FAANG is an acronym that refers to a group of five major technology companies: Facebook (now Meta), Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google (now Alphabet). These companies are known for being some of the largest and most successful technology companies in the world. They have a significant impact on the stock market and the global economy as a whole, and their stocks are often in high demand among investors.
